Oscar (Product Manager): Hey Diego, have you looked into the bug affecting Kotorina in the game? 

# Diego Rojas (Developer): 
# Yes, I've been on it all morning. 
# It seems like a tricky one. 
# First, I'll check the character's code again.
# Then, I'm going to try a different approach to debug it.
#  Finally, we will test the solution with precision.

Oscar: That sounds good. First, we need to fix it before the next update. We will need to address this bug as soon as possible.

# Diego Rojas(Developer): 
# And I'm Diego Rojas, the developer you'll be working with. Welcome aboard! 
Diego Soto: Thank you! First, I'm excited to be here. What will I be working on first? 
Oscar: Well, we're currently dealing with a bug. But generally, you're going to help us develop new features and improve our game's performance. 

# Diego Rojas: I'm going to grab some coffee. Do you want anything, Diego?

Diego Soto: That's great to hear. I'm looking forward to contributing to the team. 
(Oscar explains the company's vision and projects. Diego Rojas returns) 

# Diego Rojas: 
# Alright, back with coffee. 
# Now, about the bug – I think we're going 
# to need to rebalance Kotorina's abilities.
# Her skill set is causing the game to crash. 

Diego Soto: I see. Then, maybe we could adjust her parameters. I will look into the ability scripts and see what can be done. Finally, let's ensure we test thoroughly before rolling out the update. 
Oscar: Excellent idea. Let's regroup after lunch and come up with a solid plan. 

# Diego Rojas: 
# Sounds like a plan.
# We're going to make this game amazing! 
Diego Soto: Yes, we will!
